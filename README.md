# Title of Project: YOLOv8 vs YOLOv9: Real-Time Object Detection in Live Football Broadcasts

## Team Members:
1. Eva Mittal
2. Aditya Agnihotri
3. Devyanshi Srivastava

## Steps for Execution:
**Step 1: Clone or Download the Project Repository**
Begin by obtaining the project files from the source repository and navigate to the project directory.

**Step 2: Install Required Dependencies**
Set up the development environment by installing the necessary Python packages, including the Ultralytics YOLO library and OpenCV.

**Step 3: Organize and Configure the Dataset**
Prepare the football dataset by arranging it in the YOLO format. Ensure the image and label directories are properly structured, and configure the dataset details in the YAML file, including the class names.

**Step 4: Train the Detection Model**
Train the YOLOv8 or YOLOv9 model using the prepared dataset. Define the model type, image size, number of epochs, and dataset configuration during the training process.

**Step 5: Evaluate Model Performance**
After training, evaluate the model on the validation dataset to measure performance metrics such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).

**Step 6: Run Object Detection on New Videos**
Apply the trained model to football match videos to perform real-time object detection. The model should detect objects such as players, the ball, and referees.

**Step 7: Analyze and Visualize the Results**
Review the output videos and analyze detection performance. Compare the results of YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 based on accuracy, speed, and efficiency.

**Step 8: Document Observations and Insights**
Summarize key findings, including performance metrics, model behavior, and potential areas for improvement. Use this analysis to support the project report or presentation.
